**# Our Journey in the RoboG 2024 Competition**

As the summer break began, six university students, complete strangers to one another, came together with a common goal: to become champions of the **RoboG 2024** competition. From the very beginning, we were driven by **passion**, **curiosity**, and an eagerness to explore the capabilities of the **UGOT kits**. These kits, renowned for their versatility and innovation, opened our eyes to the fascinating world of advanced robotics. With **artificial intelligence** at its core and a highly modular design, the UGOT kit provided us with various forms of movement and control options, from **bipedal walking** to **multi-directional wheeled navigation**.

### **The Start of Something Big**

Initially, everything seemed exciting and full of promise. We were introduced to UGOT’s cutting-edge technology, which featured:

- **Wheeled & Legged Robot**: Biomimetic legs that mimicked human-like movement, offering exceptional balance and adaptability on uneven terrain.
- **Mecanum Wheel Car**: A four-wheel system that allowed omnidirectional movement, enabling us to navigate through complex and tight spaces effortlessly.
- **Self-balancing Car**: Capable of maintaining balance even while carrying heavy loads, demonstrating agility over small obstacles.
- **Spider Robot & Quadruped Robot**: With their four-legged structures, these robots mimicked the movement of animals, providing unparalleled versatility and adaptability to diverse terrains.
- **Engineer Vehicle**: Featuring a precise 3-axis mechanical arm, it was perfect for delicate tasks requiring multi-directional control.

At first, it felt like we were exploring a treasure chest of possibilities. Every function we uncovered made us more excited to push the boundaries of what we could do. The UGOT kit was like a playground for the **imagination**, offering endless combinations of tools and features. We were determined to turn this potential into something **extraordinary** and **groundbreaking**.

### **The Dark Times: Stress, Struggles, and Doubt**

However, as the days went by and the competition drew nearer, the **reality** of the challenge began to sink in. What started as an exciting adventure soon turned into a **gruelling** journey of frustration, self-doubt, and **overwhelming stress**. Integrating **artificial intelligence**, **sensor systems**, and **robotic controls** was far more complex than we had anticipated.

There were moments when the team felt **completely lost**. As newcomers to this level of technology, we often struggled with the sheer **depth** of knowledge required. Every step forward seemed to be followed by two steps back. The **UGOT kit**, though powerful, demanded precision and an understanding of the intricate mechanics behind its systems. And this is where we faltered:

- **Hardware issues** plagued us — motors refused to work as expected, **sensors** malfunctioned, and key components would fail just as we thought we were getting things right.
- Our attempts to integrate AI with the UGOT platform were fraught with complications. We would write code, test it, and then spend hours debugging just to face another **dead end**.
- There were long nights where nothing seemed to work, and **frustration** began to set in. Tensions rose within the group. Each member, under immense pressure, began to feel **isolated** in their struggles.

The initial excitement slowly turned into **doubt**. Could we really pull this off? At times, it felt like we were aimlessly wandering, without any clear direction. We started to question ourselves and each other. **Exhaustion** was taking its toll, and the once lively spirit of the team began to wane.

### **Overcoming the Obstacles: The Turning Point**

But just when we were on the verge of despair, something incredible happened. With the guidance of our mentors and professors from **HUFLIT University**, we found the strength to **push forward**. Their **unwavering support** and insightful advice helped us navigate through the most challenging parts of our journey. With their expertise, we were able to:

- Resolve our hardware issues by fine-tuning the robot’s systems and ensuring everything worked in sync.
- Fully integrate the **AI components** into the UGOT kit, utilizing **Python** for **image processing**, **facial recognition**, and **autonomous navigation**.
- Overcome the technical roadblocks that had initially seemed impossible, turning them into learning experiences that strengthened our team’s resilience.

The breakthroughs came slowly, but they came. With each small victory, our confidence grew. We started to find our rhythm as a team again, rediscovering the passion and determination that had brought us together in the first place. The excitement that once felt lost was reignited, and we became more **united** and **focused** than ever.

### **The Triumph: Securing 3rd Place**

In the end, all our hard work paid off. Against all odds, we managed to complete the competition tasks and secure **3rd place** in the **RoboG 2024** competition. It was an accomplishment that we were all incredibly proud of. Despite the challenges, setbacks, and moments of doubt, we had persevered and achieved something **remarkable**.

### **A Heartfelt Thank You**

We owe our success to the strength of our **teamwork**, the guidance of our incredible mentors, and the unwavering support from **HUFLIT University**. This journey taught us so much more than just the technical skills required to build a robot. It taught us about **resilience**, **collaboration**, and the power of **determination**. Together, we transformed a summer filled with stress and struggle into a **remarkable achievement** that none of us will ever forget.

**Thank you to my teammates, our mentors, and HUFLIT University for making this journey possible.** We couldn’t have done it without each and every one of you.
